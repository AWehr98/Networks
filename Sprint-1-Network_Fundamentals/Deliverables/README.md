## Educational Plagiarism

Let's make your own startup!

Here's how you do it:

1. Pick any well-known startup-like company: Uber, Airbnb, Instacart, Bytedance (Tik-Tok), Casper, SpaceX.

2. Pick anything else that exists.

3. Put the two together.

Airbnb for pools? [Swimply](https://swimply.com/). RVs? [RVShare](https://rvshare.com/rv/airbnb-for-rvs).

Uber for moving? [Dolly](https://dolly.com/uber-for-moving/) For haicuts? [Shortcut](https://www.getshortcut.co/).

The possibilities are endless!



### Disclaimer

Plagiarism is bad, okay? I think we've covered that a bunch of times. In general, you should treat the content of web pages and their unique styling as being the intellectual property of the creators, the same as you would for written works, music, and other pieces of visual art. As computing professionals, these rules are in your best interests, because they help give value to your skills and intellectual labor.

However, there is a long tradition of building skills by studying the work of professionals that have come before you, and this kind of work is allowed as educational fair use under copyright law. Therefore, what I'm asking you to do here should be construed as an educational exercise that's being done purely for learning with no intent to profit.

### Tips

- Spend some time looking at different pages before you choose one.

- You don't have to recreate complex graphics, charts, or figures. Replace them with any placeholder or fair-use image that you want to use.
