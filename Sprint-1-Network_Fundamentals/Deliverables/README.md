Let's make your own startup!

Here's how you do it:

1. Pick any well-known startup-like company: Uber, Airbnb, Instacart, Bytedance (Tik-Tok), Casper, Warby Parker, SpaceX.

2. Pick anything else that exists. Literally anything.

3. Put the two together.

Airbnb for pools? [Swimply](https://swimply.com/). For RVs? [RVShare](https://rvshare.com/rv/airbnb-for-rvs).

Uber for moving? [Dolly](https://dolly.com/uber-for-moving/). For haircuts? [Shortcut](https://www.getshortcut.co/).

Warby Parker for shaving? [Harry's](https://www.harrys.com/en/us).

The possibilities are endless! Compare to ["Die Hard" on an X](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieHardOnAnX) (warning: TV Tropes link).

Once you've got your startup idea, all you need to do is create a landing page to kick off your explosive customer acquisition curve and then the venture capital will flow.

Here's what I want you to do for this project:

- Create your own startup concept. It can be as serious or silly as you want, but follow the *X for Y* format.

- Build your startup's front page using Bootstrap and CSS styling. To give you some guidance, I want you to **use an existing company's webpage as the template for yours**. You can pick any page as long as it follows the Bootstrap-style row-and-column layout. Create a Bootstrap layout that mimics the one for your target page and use CSS to give it a similar look and feel.

- Write all of your HTML and CSS by hand.


### Disclaimer

Plagiarism is bad, okay? I think we've covered that a bunch of times. In general, you should treat the content of web pages and their unique styling as being the intellectual property of the creators, the same as you would for written works, music, and other pieces of visual art. As computing professionals, these rules are in your best interests, because they help give value to your skills and intellectual labor.

However, there is a long tradition of building skills by studying the work of professionals that have come before you, and this kind of work is allowed as educational fair use under copyright law. Therefore, what I'm asking you to do here should be construed as an educational exercise that's being done purely for learning with no intent to profit.

### Tips

- Spend some time looking at different pages before you choose one.

- You don't have to recreate complex graphics, charts, or figures. Replace them with any placeholder or fair-use image that you want to use.
