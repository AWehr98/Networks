*You are an AI tasked with manufacturing as many paperclips as possible. It turns out that the Universe can make a lot of paperclips.*

## Overview

An incremental game &ndash; also called a clicker game or an idle game &ndash; is a game where the main mechanic is clicking to make numbers go up. Click on a button,
get a thing. Keep clicking, get more things. Spend some of your things to get upgrades that let you get things even faster. The "things" can be whatever fits the theme of the 
game: [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) is probably the [trope codifier](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier), but
I think [Universal Paperclips](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/) is the apex of the genre.
