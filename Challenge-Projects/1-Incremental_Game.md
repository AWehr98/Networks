*You are an AI tasked with manufacturing as many paperclips as possible. It turns out that the Universe can be made into **a lot** of paperclips.*

## Overview

An incremental game &ndash; also called a clicker game or an idle game &ndash; is a game where the main mechanic is clicking to make numbers go up. Click on a button,
get a thing. Keep clicking, get more things. Spend some of your things to get upgrades that let you get things even faster. The "things" can be whatever fits the theme of the  game: [*Cookie Clicker*](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) is probably the [trope codifier](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier), but I think [*Universal Paperclips*](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/) is the apex of the genre thus far.

**I love these games**. There's something about the narcotizing repetition combined with an underlying level of optimization and wacky theming that I find
irresistable. Or maybe it's just a [Skinner Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber).

In this project, you're going to use front-end techniques to **build your own clicker game**. I've given you some code, described below, to help you get started, but everything
that you need is a straightforward application of the front-end techniques we've used in Sprints 1 and 2. After doing this project, you should feel very good about using
DOM manipulation techniques in a moderately large front-end web app. This project will also force you to think about how to manage a larger HTML/CSS/JS code base.

## Details

If you aren't familiar with the genre, start by playing Cookie Clicker. I'll see you in 7-10 days.

Okay, welcome back.

Use the code below as a starting point. It shows a basic incremental game (called "Incremental Game") that has a button that makes a number go up, some upgrades you can buy,
and some example achievements that you can unlock by doing things in the game.

You need to do the following:

- Come up with a theme for your game. Why are we clicking? What is this number that we're so concerned about increasing? I encourage to change the style and layout of my page
to work better with your theme.

- Add more upgrades. There should be a series of things the user can buy that all contribute to the goal of making the number go up.

  There should be **one final upgrade** that counts as "winning" the game. In a lot of incremental games, purchasing the winning upgrade allows you to "ascend" and restart the game, but with new special perks. You 
don't have to implement ascensions.

- Add more achievements that are appropriate for your theme.

- Finally, add at at least one special element that isn't already part of the example program. There's all kinds of options and you can get ideas by checking out more games.
  
  Many games have more than one resource and introduce dependencies between them: you might start off chopping wood, then unlock the ability to burn wood to smelt iron, but now
you have to balance your wood and iron production to keep the numbers going up. [Kittens Game](https://bloodrizer.ru/games/kittens/) has a time mechanic: the years advance as you play and some activities are easier 
or harder in different seasons. *Universal Paperclips* actually changes the goal and mechanics of the game as you advance through different phases. 
[Clicker Heroes](https://www.clickerheroes.com/) has boss battles.
